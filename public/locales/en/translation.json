The city of Perre, which is used by the people even today, and where travellers, caravans and soldiers passing through this route in ancient times stopped because of the beauty and flavour of the water flowing from the fountain, maintained its importance within the Ancient Taurus roads in the Roman period. In the Byzantine period, the city maintained its importance because it was on a major road connecting the ancient western world to the Persian (Iranian) country. Perre, which was known as Hierapolis (Holy City) in this period, participated in the Biblical Council convened in Nicaea (Nicaea) in 325 A.D. as a city of the Persidas province under the administration of Bishop Ioannes Perdos. In 433 A.D., Andreas of Samosata (Samsatli) mentioned some important bishops in Perre in his letter to Alexander, indicating that the city was also an important place in terms of religion.
